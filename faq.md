            Check your mailbox (the email belonging to the Google account who makes the donation) to see any updates about the matching transaction. If you don't see any email please
            check your spam folder or corporate firewall service. Once the donation is made there's no way to reverse a transaction, that's also a nature of any crypto transaction.
